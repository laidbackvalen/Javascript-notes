// JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES
//  WHAT IS VARIABLE? 
//  VARIABLES ARE THE STORAGES OR CONTAINER TO STORE DATA VALUES




//Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

// The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.





// JAVASCRIPT IDENTIFIERS - All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers.

// Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

// The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:   
//1.  Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
//2.     Names must begin with a letter.
//3.     Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
//4.     Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
//5.     Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
